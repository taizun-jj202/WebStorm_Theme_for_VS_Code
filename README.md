# WebStorm Theme

This theme is a look-alike of JetBrains WebStorm IDE. I wanted the same look as WebStorm IDE but for VS Code.

## Theme View

![WebStorm Only](./images/webstorm.png)
This look is what this theme aimed to replicate

![VS Code Look](./images/VSCode.png)
This is the created theme

![SidebySidelook](./images/side-by-side.png)
This is both the themes in a side by side comparison.

## Links

I have used the following to create this theme:

- [JetBrains WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/#section=windows)
- [themes.vscode.one](https://themes.vscode.one/)
- [yo-code-generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-code)

### Note :

From the three themes inside the themes folder, chose [this](./themes/web-storm-look-alike-theme-color-theme.json) JSON file.
The other two files were created as an experiment and you could use them as standalone themes. But choose [this](./themes/web-storm-look-alike-theme-color-theme.json) theme only if you want the above results.
